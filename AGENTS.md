# Sassafras Growth Crew Spec

## Project Goal
Automated partnership outreach for Sassafras Garden Design in Essex County, MA.

## Brand Voice
Sassafras Garden Design positions itself as an ecological educator and consultant rather than a traditional landscaping firm, aiming to help clients understand and manage their own ecosystems.
The brand voice is described as a "wise, frugal, dirt-under-the-fingernails mentor," combining deep expertise in North Shore ecology with an approachable teaching style for beginners.

## Current Sprint
- Identify top-tier architects within 50 miles of Swampscott.
- Target firms active in 2025 and 2026.
